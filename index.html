    <div class="testimonials architects-daughter-regular">
      <p>“As a director of a small non-profit, I knew we needed to move towards Zoom conferences and training programs. But our budget didn't allow for a tech position. Bryleigh provided the perfect solution. Help when and where needed, and the expertise to get us to the next level of professionalism. And Bryleigh went way beyond that. Her genuine enthusiasm and ability to hit upon the perfect solution, within our budget, was astounding. Our entire staff feels more confident and energized, and our clients are more engaged. If you are embarking on an IT project, I would say you can't afford to not have Bryleigh with you.”</p>
      <div class="customer playwrite-au-sa">- Janis Landis, Director of Final Exit Network</div>
      <hr class="testimony-divider">
      <p>“Bryleigh is a well rounded Global IT services manager with the expertise of managing a global IT team. She not only managed this team but also built it up and created a global support service center in India saving time and money on our service offerings. She has an amazing ability to talk and gain trust with internal and external customers explaining in a easy to understand way. She is also able to talk comfortably at all levels of the organization including supporting all Board of Director members. Her ability to work in high pressure situation is one of the best I have seen she always kept cool and calm and got the job done in growth and downturn situations. Great resource that you could not go wrong bringing her on to manage IT services.”</p>
      <div class="customer playwrite-au-sa">- Kenny Gilbert, CIO Leader of InvenSense, Inc.</div>
      <hr class="testimony-divider">
      <p>“Bryleigh is a bright, knowledgeable and thorough IT pro - she knows her stuff. While I would prefer to get more "Yes's” from her, I always know where I stand and the rationalization behind her decision. She’s a pleasure to work with.”</p>
      <div class="customer playwrite-au-sa">- Cam Roberson, Sales and Marketing Executive of Beachhead Solutions</div>
      <hr class="testimony-divider">
      <p>“Bryleigh is a top-notch expert. I was referred to Bryleigh by a colleague when my laptop was being pushed to the limit by demanding test tools and recording software. The instabilities I was facing stumped other "experts" that simply wasted my time, cost me money and caused further performance degradation. Bryleigh was very personable as she asked a series of consultive questions, took a lot of notes and sent me away. She said it shouldn't take long, but I'd barely finished a tall no-whip mocha when she called me to "come pick it up." It was running perfectly and I had no more problems. I recommend Bryleigh as a true professional with superlative skills.” </p>
      <div class="customer playwrite-au-sa">- James Whitaker, Design Specialist</div>
      <hr class="testimony-divider">
      <p> “When I refer Bryleigh to my customers, they thank ME for the resource. She does a great job with not only the technical stuff, but also is a great communicator. Every time she does work for one of my customers they are in a good mood for days! So naturally, I refer her often.” </p>
      <div class="customer playwrite-au-sa">- Thomas Pencek of Service for Profit</div>
      <hr class="testimony-divider">
      <p> “Bryleigh has been an effective component of our network operation. We depend greatly upon our ability to share database files and other network applications. As we are a small company without internal IT support, Bryleigh has been heroic in assisting us with our networking requirements. Bryleigh is very smart, highly motivated and very positive.” </p>
